Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Task 5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization
As part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, Task 5 focused on analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns associated with road conditions, weather, time of day, and location-based factors. The goal was to identify accident hotspots and visualize the contributing elements behind road incidents using a real-world dataset.

Overview
I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large-scale U.S. traffic accident dataset. By examining variables such as weather conditions, visibility, time, and location, I was able to identify key risk factors and trends in accident occurrences. I also visualized geographic accident hotspots and time-based patterns to provide meaningful insights for traffic management and road safety improvement.
